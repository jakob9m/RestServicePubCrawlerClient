     <TextArea class="InfoBox" rows="10" cols="10" readonly> Have you ever felt the urge for a specific beer? 
     Yearning for that Norrlands guld perhaps, or that Pripps blå? But wandering from pub to pub, searching for that particular beer can be a challenge in itself, both confusing and timeconsuming.
     Wandering aimlessly down the streets of Lund in an endless search of your favorite beer. In order to save you time and effort, 
     we therefore introduce PubCrawler! 
     
     The perfect website for the search of the perfect beer! Here you can easily see which pubs have which beers. 
      You can also help PubCrawler by inserting your own knowledge and adding both beers and pubs to help your fellow beerconsumers in their search for the perfect experience.
